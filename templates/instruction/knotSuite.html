                Apps make using your PC easier by opening up new ways for you to get things done and have some fun.
                Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1 come with built-in apps that help you socialize, stay in touch,
                share and view documents, organize photos, listen to music, and watch movies, but you can find
                even more apps in the Windows Store.Note: You need to have Windows 8.1 or Windows RT 8.1 to
                see and install apps from the Windows Store. If you donâ€™t have Windows 8.1 or Windows RT 8.1,
                you can check out some of the popular apps available in the Store.
